# Fibonacci Memoization Demo
This repository showcases a traditional recursive approach to calculating the nth index of the fibonacci sequence, alongside a dynamic programming approach, which introduces memoization.

**Requirements:**
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To run this program, execute the following:
```bash
$ node runner.js <index>
```

Where index is the index within the fibonacci sequence that you wish to calculate.

This will calculate the value of the nth fibonacci sequence for both algorithms, and report how much "work" was done for each algorithm.

"Work" is defined here as the number of recursive calls executed.
